/*
Package trie implements a trie data-structure similar to the one described by
Donald E Knuth in “Programming Perls”. (Communications of the ACM,
Vol. 29, No. 6, June 1986,
https://cecs.wright.edu/people/faculty/pmateti/Courses/7140/PDF/cwp-knuth-cacm-1986.pdf).

The trie is suitable for write-once-read-many-times situations. The idea is to
spend some effort to create a compact but efficient dictionary for categorical data.
